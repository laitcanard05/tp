## Introduction

Welcome to FinBro, your personal finance management companion.

FinBro is a desktop application optimized for use via an Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI). If you prefer typing to clicking, FinBro offers an intuitive way to manage your finances more efficiently than traditional GUI applications, with a guided approach that simplifies data entry.

Key capabilities include:
- Recording income and expenses with detailed categorization
- Setting and tracking monthly budgets
- Establishing and monitoring savings goals
- Searching and filtering transactions
- Generating financial summaries and reports
- Exporting data for external analysis

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest `FinBro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-W13-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for FinBro.
4. Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder where you placed the jar file.
5. Run the application using: `java -jar FinBro.jar`
6. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
7. Follow the interactive prompts to complete the command.
8. Type `help` and press Enter to display a summary of available commands.

## Understanding the Interface

FinBro uses an interactive command approach. Rather than requiring you to type complex commands with multiple parameters, it guides you through each step:

1. You enter a basic command keyword, like `income` or `Expense` (case-insensitive)
2. FinBro prompts you for each piece of information needed
3. You provide the information one step at a time
4. The command is completed once all necessary information is gathered

This approach makes the application more user-friendly and reduces errors in command syntax.

A: Yes, you can use up to 2 decimal places for transaction amounts (e.g., 25.50).

**Q: What happens if I enter invalid input?**

A: FinBro provides clear error messages and usually prompts you to try again. The interactive design helps prevent many common input errors.
