# Lim Jun Fun - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
Our team developed FinBro, a personal finance tracker application designed for command-line interaction. It allows users to manage their income and expenses, search and filter transactions, and gain financial insights with minimal friction.

I have focused on implementing the some key functionalities for the application and implementing some JUnit test cases to ensure the application is working as intended.

### Enhancements Implemented

1. **Core Financial Commands in v1.0**
    * Implemented the following commands:
        * `view` / `balance`
          *  What it does: Generates a report of expenses and income for the user to keep track.
          * Justification: Allows user to quickly track the total expenses and income to allow the user to properly allocate budget accordingly.
        * `edit`
          * What it does: Allows the user to update any entry he/she has made to the application.
          * Justification: This allows the user to quickly make changes to their original entry if they have made a mistake to it or they would just want to update with the most accurate value at hand.
    * Enabled guided input mode for `edit` command.
        * What it does: Allows the user to input the fields that they would want to edit.
        * Justification: To allow users to not be overwelmed by the amount of information they are required to input for one-line inputs, and reduces the errors prone for a failed edit.

2. **Enhancement of existing classes** 
    * Enhanced `Ui.java` with functions such as `readAmount`, `readDescription`, `readDate`, `readCategory` to enable smoother user input for the application and allows the user to input information as an option.
    * Reconfigured `LoggingConfig.java` to adjust the priority levels of logging, to not spam the user with all the logging messages that are unnecessary, and to provide appropriate logging levels for different runtime scenarios.
    * Created `updateTransaction` and `getTransaction` for ease of use of EditCommand to amend anything within the transaction list, and to simplify data manipulation.
3. **Implementation of JUnit Tests**
    * Developed comprehensive JUnit tests for multiple commands:
      * `EditCommand` 
      * `BalanceCommand` 
      * `ClearCommand`
      * `LoggingConfig`
      * `SetBudgetCommandTest`
      * `SetSavingsGoalCommand`
      * `TrackBudgetCommand`
      * `TrackSavingsGoalCommand`, 
    * Updated and expanded existing test suites for `Ui` and `Parser` classes.
